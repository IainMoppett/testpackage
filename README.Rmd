# testpackage

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of testpackage is to provide some helper functions for people working with HSRC or other projects.  

There are currently three independent tools.

`pretty_plot` adds a logo and some text (e.g. source, date etc) to a plot.
`theme_HSRC` creates a ggplot theme 
`QR_save` generates a series of QR codes from a csv file of URLs and titles. Useful for presentations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of testpackage from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("IainMoppett/testpackage")
```

## Example

### QR_save

Use the `QR_save` function to save a series of pdfs of QR codes with a helpful title. Online tools tend to give a rather unhelpful 'file.png' as the output.

```{r example}
library(testpackage)
## basic example code

QR_save(system.file("extdata", "QR_Data.csv", package = "testpackage"))
```


You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

### Pretty_plot

Adds a logo at the bottom right and some text (e.g. data source) at the bottom left.

```{r pretty_plot, echo = FALSE}
library(testpackage)
library(ggplot2)

pl_1 <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + geom_point()
pl_1_no_legend <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
geom_point(show.legend = FALSE)

pl_1
pl_1_no_legend
pp_pl_1 <- pretty_plot(pl_1, source = "Text 14 point",
logo_path = system.file("extdata", "SNAP3_2019.jpg", package = "testpackage"),
text_size = 14)

pp_pl_1
pp_pl_1_no_legend <- pretty_plot(pl_1, source = "Text 16 point",
logo_path = system.file("extdata", "SNAP3_2019.jpg", package = "testpackage"),
text_size = 16)
pp_pl_1_no_legend
```
